Got a new job at a dental clinic working as a receptionist and as the dev of their dentail patient manager and things have been going pretty great. For the first time in my life I'm actually busy and finding free time with all the side projects i'm making is difficult.

## the real issue

I can't keep up with everything in my life. Things are moving way too fast, people are coming in and out of my life left right and center, its just difficult to keep up.
