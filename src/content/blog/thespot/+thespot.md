Finding a place to hangout at with my friends has always been a struggle, but a few months back I found a pretty obscure location. Here, have a look:

<CaptionImage image="thespot.png" alt="the spot." source="/src/content/blog/thespot/thespot.png" sizes="50rem"/>

Pretty neat eh? May not look like much, but on top of these *pillars* I've had some of the most down to earth conversations of my life. I've absolutely fallen in love with this place, in fact, I go up there alone sometimes and crack open a white monster.

## the view

<style>
  @media (max-width: 600px) {
    .video-row {
      display: block !important;
    }
  }
</style>
<div class="video-row" style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 1rem;">
  <video
    src="/thespot.mp4"
    width="400"
    controls
    style="display:block;"
  ></video>
  <div>
    <p>Some of the views here are absolutely amazing, especially when the sun is setting. I don't know what it is about this place that I love so much. We've tried going to other places too but its just not the same. I'll never forget all the conversations, snacks and drinks that I've had here.</p><br>
    <h2>the interesting thing</h2>
    <p>I've never been the type of person to have a serious chat with. All my other conversations are lighthearted and funny, but when I'm here everything I talk about is always so serious and deep.</p>

## why did I write this?

To be honest, I don't really know. I've never had a blog before and posting parts of my life feels so interesting. I've been making a habit of expressing myself more lately and this feels like the perfect way. With all that out of the way, thanks for reading :)
