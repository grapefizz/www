Got a new job at a dental clinic working as a receptionist and as the dev of their dental patient manager and things have been going pretty great. For the first time in my life I'm actually busy and finding free time with all the side projects i'm making is difficult.

## the real issue

I can't keep up with everything in my life. Things are moving way too fast, people are coming in and out of my life left right and center, its just difficult to keep up.

I've been thinking about my future a lot this summer. What I'll do, where I'll end up, and I just don't know what i'm going to do.

## the end

Thanks for listening to me rant : )
